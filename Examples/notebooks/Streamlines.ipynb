    "# Streamlines tutorial\n",
    "In this tutorial you will learn how to download and render streamline data to display connectivity data. In brief, injections of anterogradely transported viruses are performed in wild type and CRE-driver mouse lines. The viruses express fluorescent proteins so that efferent projections from the injection locations can be traced everywhere in the brain. The images with the fluorescence data are acquired and registered to the Allen Coordinates reference frame. The traces of the streamlines are then extracted using a fast marching algorithm (by [https://neuroinformatics.nl](https://neuroinformatics.nl)).\n",

    "The connectivity data are produced as part of the Allen Brain Atlas [Mouse Connectivity project](http://connectivity.brain-map.org).\n",

    "The first step towards being able to render streamlines data is to identify the set of experiments you are interested in (i.e. injections in the primary visual cortex of wild type mice]. To do so you can use the experiments explorer at [http://connectivity.brain-map.org].\n",
